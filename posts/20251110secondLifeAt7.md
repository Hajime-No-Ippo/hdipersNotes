# The Great Experiment: Pivoting to a Second Life at 7 AM

## 1. The Internal Reset
I have been in Ireland for two months now. On the surface, I am adjusting to a new country, meeting new people, and experiencing a different culture. But the real "newness" isn't about the scenery—it's about my inner self.

The biggest change is my attitude toward life. Part of it is the fresh soil I'm standing on; part of it is my own willingness to change. I’ve started doing and saying things I never would have done before. Whether the feedback is positive or negative, I accept it all. I am adjusting, opening up, and letting the world reshape me.

# 伟大的实验：在清晨七点开启第二人生

## 1. 内在的重置
来到爱尔兰已经两个月了。表面上看，我正在适应一个新的国家，结识不同的人，体验陌生的文化。但真正的“崭新”，无关风景，而关乎我的内在。

我最大的改变是对生活的态度。这既是因为脚下这片新鲜的土地，也是因为我主观上渴望改变。我开始尝试做以前从未做过的事，说以前从未说过的话。无论得到的反馈是好是坏，我都全盘接受。我在调整，在敞开，在让这个世界重塑我。

## 2. Can an Old Dog Learn New Tricks?
The biggest thing I am doing, of course, is studying.
I left university more than 10 years ago. Before coming here, I was plagued with doubts: Can I still memorize new concepts? Can I handle projects? Can I pull all-nighters and still show up for class the next morning? Basically, does my brain still work like that?

To my surprise, I didn't just study—I became obsessed.
Due to visa issues, I arrived a whole week late for the 3-week Java crash course. I was behind before I even started. My original plan was cautious: "Try it for 2 months, then decide if I stay for the full year."
But after just two weeks, the decision was made. I am staying.

## 2. 老狗还能学会新把戏吗？
我现在做的最重要的事情，当然是学习。
我离开大学已经超过十年了。来这里之前，我充满自我怀疑：我还能记住新概念吗？我还能搞定项目吗？我还能熬夜之后第二天照常上课吗？本质上，我怀疑自己还能不能学习。

令我惊讶的是，我不仅能学，我还着魔了。
因为签证问题，那个为期三周的 Java 快进班，我迟到了整整一周。还没开始我就已经落后了。我最初的计划很谨慎：“先试两个月，再决定要不要读完这一年。”
但仅仅过了两周，我就做出了决定。我要留下。

## 3. From Law to Logic: The Joy of 7-23
Career changing is not easy, but having the time to do what you truly love is a blessing.
I was the student who was good at math and science, the brain-twisting subjects. But I took a detour. I went to law school and worked in the legal field for years. I wasn't bad at law; I tried innovative ways to communicate with clients and judges. Some worked, some didn't.
But deep down, I missed the clarity of numbers.

So, here I am.
I code from 7 AM to 11 PM (7-23). I often forget to eat for the entire day. When I finally stand up to walk to the rail station, I realize my legs are weak, but my mind is electric. I realized how utterly absorbed I was.
My wife calls it "flow." I call it coming home.

## 3. 从法律到逻辑：早七晚十一的快乐
转行并不容易，但能拥有一段完整的时光去做自己最感兴趣的事，是一种福报。
我曾经是那种擅长数理化、喜欢烧脑科目的学生。但我绕了个弯路，去了法学院，在法律界工作了很多年。我也做得不赖，我尝试过用创新的方式与客户和法官沟通，有些成功了，有些没有。
但在内心深处，我一直怀念数字的那种清晰感。

所以，我到了这里。
我从早上 7 点写代码写到晚上 11 点。我经常一整天都忘了吃饭。当我终于站起来走向火车站时，我才发现腿都软了，但大脑却像通了电一样兴奋。我才意识到自己沉浸得有多深。
我老婆管这叫“心流”。我管这叫“回家”。

## 4. The Great Experiment
Why can I do this? It’s complex.
But the philosophy of "do-it-first-and-see-what-happens" brought me here.
I can't explain it perfectly yet, partially because I'm writing in a foreign language, but mostly because I'm still figuring it out myself.
This is a big, really big experiment for me and my family. I might be doing the right thing—my wife is happy with my attitude, and I saved enough to keep us safe.

Pivoting to a second life is not only possible; it is my chance to become new, to become different, and to finally be the person I always wanted to be.

So, cheers! Be busy, be crazy, be happy!

## 4. 伟大的实验
为什么我能做到这些？原因很复杂。
但“先做再说，看看会发生什么”的哲学把我带到了这里。
我现在还无法完美地解释它，一部分是因为我在用外语写作，但更多是因为我自己也还在探索的路上。
这对我，对我的家庭来说，都是一个巨大的、真正的实验。我也许做对了——毕竟我老婆对我的状态很满意，我也存了够用的钱。

转向“第二人生”不仅是可能的，更是我重塑自我、成为那个我一直想成为的人的绝佳机会。

所以，干杯！去忙碌，去疯狂，去快乐！
