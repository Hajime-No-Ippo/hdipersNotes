# The 16-Minute Exam and the Lost Arc'teryx

## 1. The Shock in the Exam Room
Today, I walked out of the Lab Exam after just 16 minutes and 57 seconds.
The last time, I scored 61. This time, I am confident it’s a 100.
The invigilator looked at me, shocked. My classmates were still clicking furiously.
I realized something: The past two months of LeetCode grinding didn't just help me with algorithms; it fundamentally upgraded my **Coding Proficiency**. School assignments now feel like slow-motion practice targets.
I felt a rush of validation. The pain was worth it.

# 16分钟的考试与丢失的始祖鸟

## 1. 考场里的震惊
今天，我在开考 16 分 57 秒后走出了考场。
上一次，我考了 61 分。这一次，我确信是满分。
监考老师震惊地看着我。我的同学们还在疯狂点击鼠标。
我意识到：过去两个月 LeetCode 的磨练，不仅帮我掌握了算法，更是根本性地升级了我的 **代码掌控力 (Coding Proficiency)**。学校的作业现在感觉就像是慢动作的练习靶。
我感受到了一股强烈的验证感。那些痛苦，值了。

## 2. The Cost of Single-Threaded Focus
But there is a price.
I realized I've been running on a "Single-Threaded" mode. My CPU was 100% dedicated to LeetCode videos on my phone.
The result? I left my brand new Arc'teryx backpack (bought just a week ago!) on the train.
When I arrived at the library, I felt strangely "light." Then it hit me: The bag was gone.
Inside were my dinner (salmon), an Apple mouse, and cables.
Strangely, I didn't panic. I just thought, *"Thank God my MacBook and iPad are safe in the school locker."*
I lost a bag, but I kept my code. My RAM was so full of algorithms that the "carry bag" process just crashed.

## 2. 单线程专注的代价
但是，这是有代价的。
我意识到我一直运行在“单线程”模式下。我的 CPU 100% 都在处理手机里的 LeetCode 视频。
结果？我把刚买才一周的始祖鸟背包落在了火车上。
当我走到图书馆时，我感到一阵奇怪的“轻松”。然后我才反应过来：包没了。
包里有我的晚餐（三文鱼）、一个苹果鼠标和几根线。
奇怪的是，我并没有恐慌。我满脑子想的都是：*“感谢上帝，我的 MacBook 和 iPad 还锁在学校的柜子里。”*
我丢了一个包，但我保住了我的代码。我的内存里塞满了算法，以至于“拿包”这个后台进程直接崩溃了。

## 3. The New Challenge: Multi-threading
Life is not LeetCode. Life is concurrency.
I cannot code 18 hours a day forever. I have exams, I have a family to prepare for, and I have packs to keep.
The exam today was a wake-up call. I proved I have the **Burst Capacity** (sprinting). Now I need **Stability** (uptime).
My new challenge is not just solving Hard problems, but solving the problem of **Context Switching**.
I need to upgrade my OS from DOS (one thing at a time) to Unix (multitasking).
I want to keep the fire, but I also want to keep my backpack.

## 3. 新的挑战：多线程
生活不是 LeetCode。生活是并发 (Concurrency)。
我不可能永远每天写 18 小时代码。我有考试，我有家人要通过来做准备，我还有背包要保管。
今天的考试是一个叫醒服务。我证明了我拥有 **爆发力 (Burst Capacity)**。现在我需要 **稳定性 (Stability)**。
我新的挑战不仅仅是解出 Hard 题，而是解决 **上下文切换 (Context Switching)** 的问题。
我需要把我的操作系统从 DOS（一次一件事）升级到 Unix（多任务处理）。
我想留住那团火，但也想留住我的背包。
