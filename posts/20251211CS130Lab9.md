# 1. The Core Challenge
Lab 9 is not just about writing code; it's about **Efficiency**.
We are dealing with a classic graph problem where we need to find the shortest path.
However, the naive approach will **Time Out (TLE)**.

Here is the logic flow of our optimized solution:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Input Data] --> B{Is Cache Valid?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return Cached Result]
    B -- No --> D[Initialize PriorityQueue]
    D --> E[Dijkstra Algorithm]
    E --> F[Store in Cache]
    F --> G[Return Result]
