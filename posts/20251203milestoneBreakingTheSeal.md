# The Milestone

Today, December 3rd, marks a pivotal moment in my coding journey.
I solved a LeetCode Medium problem (BST to Greater Sum Tree) completely on my own. No tutorials, no AI hints, no peeking at solutions. Just me and the logic.

For a veteran programmer, this is nothing. But for me, a 43-year-old ex-lawyer who started from zero on October 11th, this is everything.
It’s been nearly two months. I knew I was close. I could read code, I could understand logic, but writing it out independently felt like there was a thin, invisible wall blocking me.
Today, I punched through that wall.

# 里程碑

今天，12月3日，是我编程之旅的一个关键时刻。
我完全独立地解出了一道 LeetCode Medium 题（二叉搜索树转累加树）。没有看教程，没有问 AI，没有偷看答案。只有我和逻辑。

对于一个资深程序员来说，这不算什么。但对于我，一个从10月11日零基础起步的43岁前律师来说，这就是一切。
快两个月了。我知道我很接近了。我能读懂代码，能理解逻辑，但在独立写出来之前，总感觉有一层看不见的薄墙挡着我。
今天，我一拳打穿了这堵墙。

# 1. The Meaning of "Copying"
Looking back at my submission history, I see "Accepted" records from a month ago.
I know the truth: those were basically "copied." I understood the logic, but I typed them out with the solution open on another screen.
At the time, I thought it was meaningless. But now I see differently.
Those "copied" submissions were the background noise for today's clarity. They were the necessary friction.
**The meaning of failure (or copying) lies in its contrast with success.** Without that feeling of "I'm faking it," the joy of "I actually did it" wouldn't be so sweet.

# 1. “抄写”的意义
回头看我的提交记录，我看到了一个月前的“通过”记录。
我知道真相：那些基本属于“抄”下来的。我懂逻辑，但我是在另一个屏幕开着答案的情况下敲出来的。
当时，我觉得那是没有意义的。但现在我看待它的方式变了。
那些“抄写”的记录，是今天清晰时刻的背景音。它们是必要的摩擦力。
**失败（或者说抄写）的意义，在于它与成功的对比。** 如果没有那种“我在假装会”的心虚感，今天这种“我真做到了”的快感就不会如此甜美。

# 2. Radical Honesty
The most important lesson I've learned isn't about Binary Trees or Stacks. It's about **Honesty**.
Failure isn't scary. Being slow isn't scary.
What's scary is being dishonest—especially with yourself.
If I had kept pretending I "knew" it because I copied the code, I would never have broken through.
I admitted I was weak. I admitted I needed to memorize templates. I admitted I needed help.
And because I was honest about my ignorance, I finally earned my knowledge.

A good start is 90% of success. And today, I finally started.

# 2. 极致的诚实
我学到的最重要的一课，不是关于二叉树或栈的，而是关于**诚实**。
失败不可怕。慢也不可怕。
可怕的是不诚实——尤其是对自己不诚实。
如果我一直因为抄了代码就假装自己“会了”，我永远也无法突破。
我承认我很弱。我承认我需要背模版。我承认我需要帮助。
正因为我对自己的无知保持了诚实，我才终于赢得了我的知识。

好的开始是成功的 90%。而今天，我终于开始了。

# 3. Inverting the Proverb
There is an old Chinese saying: *"The journey of a hundred miles is half complete at ninety."* (行百里者半九十). It warns us that the final stretch is the hardest.

But today, I realized the opposite is true for us builders.
**The moment you actually start, you are 90% done.**

In physics, **Static Friction** (the force needed to get an object moving) is always greater than **Kinetic Friction** (the force to keep it moving).
The anxiety before opening the IDE, the hesitation before stepping onto the cold train platform, the fear before the exam starts—that is the massive Static Friction.
Once you move, momentum takes over. The code writes itself. The exam answers flow.

Don't worry about the last 10 miles. Worry about the first step.
**Start, and you have already won.**

# 3. 反转古谚
中国有句古话叫“行百里者半九十”。它的意思是，事情越接近终点越艰难。

但今天，我意识到对于我们这些建设者来说，事实恰恰相反。
**真正开始的那一刻，其实你已经完成了 90%。**

在物理学中，**静摩擦力**（让物体动起来所需的力）永远大于**动摩擦力**（维持物体运动所需的力）。
打开 IDE 前的焦虑、踏上寒冷站台前的犹豫、考试开始前的恐惧——这些都是巨大的静摩擦力。
一旦你动起来了，惯性就会接管一切。代码会顺着指尖流淌，答案会自然浮现。

别担心最后那十里路。去担心第一步吧。
**只要开始，你就已经赢了。**
