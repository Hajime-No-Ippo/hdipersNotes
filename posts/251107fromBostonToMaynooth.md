# Fate's Detour: From Boston Rejection to Maynooth Rain

*(The Eolas Building, where the journey began)*

## 1. The Door Slammed Shut
Maybe it was destiny. I never considered Ireland. My immigration endpoint was always supposed to be the United States.  
I had a full scholarship to Boston in my hand. It was perfect.  
But reality has a cruel sense of humor. Not only was my student visa rejected, but my existing 10-year tourist visa was revoked on the spot.  
The road I had mapped out for years instantly vanished.

# 命运的改道：从波士顿的拒信到梅努斯的雨

![Eolas 大楼|600](https://assets.flowstates.me/2025/20251128eolas.jpg)
*(Eolas 大楼，一切开始的地方)*

## 1. 被狠狠关上的门
或许是天注定，我从来没考虑过爱尔兰。我移民的终点本该是美国。  
我当时手里已经拿到了波士顿的全奖录取，一切看似完美。  
但现实开了一个残酷的玩笑。我不但学签被拒，连原本持有的10年旅游签也被当场吊销（Revoked）。  
我规划多年的路，瞬间消失了。

## 2. The Ghostly Clever Partner
I would have given up if not for my wife. She is resilient, relentless, and, as I like to say, "ghostly clever."  
"Try Ireland CS programs," she insisted.  
I applied. The result? Rejection or silence from almost everywhere.  
The only acceptance came from Maynooth University—and that only happened because I emailed them to ask why they hadn't replied.  
It felt less like a choice and more like the universe leaving me exactly one narrow path.

## 2. 不屈不挠的“鬼机灵”
如果不是我老婆，我可能就放弃了。她有着惊人的韧性，不屈不挠，又透着一股“鬼机灵”。  
“试试爱尔兰的 CS 项目，”她坚持道。  
我试了。结果呢？几乎所有的申请都石沉大海。  
唯一录取我的就是梅努斯大学——而这也还是在我发邮件去询问之后，才勉强给的录取。  
这感觉不像是做选择，更像是宇宙只给我留了这一条窄路。

## 3. The Missing Passport and The Harbin Court
The drama didn't end with admission. My Irish visa was approved, but my passport vanished for a month. It usually takes two days.  
Classes had already started. I was losing patience. I messaged the visa office: "Give me my passport. I've paid tuition, but if I can't fly, I'm demanding a refund."  
The next day, I was in Harbin for a court hearing.  
The moment I stepped off the plane, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my wife: The passport is here.  
Three days later, I landed in Ireland.

## 3. 消失的护照与哈尔滨开庭
录取并不意味着结束，戏剧性还在继续。我的爱尔兰签证批准了一个月，护照却迟迟收不到（正常只需要2天）。  
学校已经开学了。我终于失去了耐心，催促道：“赶紧把护照还给我，我已经交了学费，再不给我，我就要申请退费了。”  
第二天，我在哈尔滨有一个开庭。  
刚下飞机，手机震动，是我老婆发来的好消息：护照到了。  
三天后，我顺利登陆爱尔兰。

## 4. The Java Shock
On my second day in Ireland, I walked into the classroom.  
I quickly realized the magnitude of my situation. I was a full week behind in an intensive three-week Java crash course.  
I had zero background. I was completely clueless. The blow to my confidence was immense.  
I sat there, listening to concepts I couldn't grasp, wondering if I had made a terrible mistake.

## 4. Java 的当头一棒
到爱尔兰的第二天，我走进了教室。  
我才发现情况有多严重。这是一门为期三周的 Java 快进班，而我已经整整落后了一周。  
我是零基础。我完全听不懂，完全没有头绪。  
那种打击是巨大的。我坐在那里，听着那些我无法理解的概念，怀疑自己是否犯了一个可怕的错误。

## 5. Two Months Later: The Only Chance
It has been exactly two months today. I survived.  
It was exhausting, but it was worth every second.  
I told my classmate: "I have never worked this hard in my life, and I never will again."  
This is my only chance.  
I don't care about grades. I don't care about money. I don't care about fame.  
I only care that I am learning something I want to learn, something I am becoming good at.  
My wife calls this state "Flow."  
I call it survival.

## 5. 两个月后：唯一的机会
到今天正好两个月。我坚持下来了。  
很辛苦，但很值得。  
我告诉我的同学：“我这辈子从来没有这么用功过，今后也不会了。”  
这是我唯一的机会。  
我不在乎成绩，不在乎金钱，不在乎名声。  
我只在乎我学到了我想学的东西，我正在掌握一门我擅长的手艺。  
和我老婆一样，她说，这是“心流”。  
而我管这叫生存。
