# Battling the "Cunning Organ"

## 1. The Morning Curse
Yesterday and today were brutal.
I woke up excited, ready to conquer the code. But the moment I sat down, the resistance hit. I couldn't understand. I got stuck.
I started cursing—cursing the code, cursing myself.
"Maybe I'm wrong," I thought. "Maybe a 43-year-old brain just decays. Maybe it can't be rewired."
It was painful. But I kept doing it. Because if I don't do it, what is left?
Success or failure—I won't know until I finish.

# 与那个狡猾器官的战争

## 1. 清晨的咒骂
昨天和今天的经历，真的很残酷。
早上醒来时我还是兴致勃勃的，准备去征服代码。但一坐下来，阻力就来了。看不懂，卡住，写不出。
我开始骂人——骂代码，骂我自己。
“也许我错了，”我心想，“也许43岁的大脑只会变得更差，也许它根本无法被重塑。”
很痛苦。但我还是坚持做了。因为如果不做，我们还能看什么呢？
是成功还是失败，做了才知道。

## 2. The Management of Pain
I used to think success was about how much pain you could endure.
Now I realize: Success isn't about maximizing pain; it's about finding the best method to make the pain *less painful*.
It's about efficiency, not masochism.
But the pain is real. It is the friction of change.

# 2. 痛苦的管理学
我以前以为，成功在于你能忍受多么大的痛苦。
现在我明白了：成功的难点不在于“能吃苦”，而在于懂得用最好的办法让痛苦变得“不那么痛”。
这是关于效率，而不是受虐。
但痛苦是真实的。它是改变所带来的摩擦力。

## 3. The Enemy Within
Mental construction is everything because the brain is a bad guy.
It loves to be lazy. It loves comfort.
We are not fighting "ourselves"; we are fighting a **cunning organ** that has evolved for millions of years to save energy and avoid work.
It wants you to stop. It wants you to scroll on your phone. It wants you to sleep.
This is not a lack of willpower; this is biology.

# 3. 内部的敌人
心理建设真的很重要，因为大脑是个坏家伙。
它就喜欢偷懒，喜欢舒适。
我们不是在和“自己”较劲，我们是在和这个**进化了千万年的狡猾器官**较劲。
它想让你停下来，想让你刷手机，想让你睡觉。这是它的生物本能——为了省能量。
这不是意志力薄弱，这是生物学。

## 4. Master or Slave?
To be your true self, you must tame this old guy.
You have to discipline it, train it, and sometimes, force it.
If you don't, you become its slave.
I shudder to think how many people are enslaved by this cunning organ, living their whole lives on autopilot, obeying its command to "take it easy."
I refuse. I will break it, and I will rebuild it.

# 4. 主人还是奴隶？
调教好它，你才是真的自己。
你必须管教它，训练它，有时甚至要强迫它。
否则，你就是这个老家伙的奴隶。
我不敢想，这个世界上有多少人被它奴役着，在大脑发出的“轻松点”的指令下，浑浑噩噩地度过了一生。
我拒绝。我要打破它，然后重塑它。
