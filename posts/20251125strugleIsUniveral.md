# The Commuter Code

## 1. The Universal Struggle
This morning on the train, a middle-aged man from Bangladesh noticed me coding. He was curious.
I was tackling a LeetCode "Hard" problem (Sliding Window). He wanted to give it a try.
I knew it was impossible for him, but I didn't want to embarrass him. He sheepishly admitted, *"I learned C 20 years ago, I don't know Java."*
I smiled and told him it didn't matter.
We started talking about life in a foreign land. He said he was job hunting and struggling.
I told him: *"It doesn't matter what status we have or how much money we make. We are all struggling. This is the norm. Because we are not satisfied with the status quo; we want change, we want to be different."*

# 通勤列车上的代码

## 1. 普世的挣扎
今天早上在火车上，一位来自孟加拉的中年男子注意到了我在写代码。他很好奇。
我当时正在刷一道 LeetCode 的 Hard 题（滑动窗口）。他试图想试一下。
我知道这对他来说是不可能的，但我没有让他难堪。他不好意思地承认：*“我20年前学过C语言，我不懂Java。”*
我笑着告诉他没关系。
我们聊起了在异国他乡的生活。他说他正在找工作，很挣扎（Struggling）。
我对他说：*“无论我们处于什么地位，有多少钱，我们都在挣扎。这是常态。因为我们不满足于现状，我们要改变，我们要不同。”*

## 2. The "Good Start" Theory
Walking off the train, I messaged my wife on WhatsApp. I realized why I was so exhausted before: my direction was wrong.
The old saying goes, *"A good start is half the success."*
I disagree. I think **a good start is 80% of the success.**
A truly "good start" requires material, mental, and strategic preparation. It is incredibly hard to get right.
In the "do-and-see-what-happens" phase, we often retreat or fail. Why? Simply because we weren't ready. We didn't have a "good start."

## 2. “好的开始”理论
下火车的时候，我和老婆发 WhatsApp。我意识到我之前之所以学得那么累，其实是因为方向不对。
俗话说，“万事开头难，好的开始是成功的一半。”
我不同意。我认为**好的开始是成功的 80%。**
一个真正“好的开始”，需要物质、精神和策略的多方面准备。这很难做到。
在“先做再说”的阶段，我们会遇到困难，会退缩，会失败。原因？其实很简单，就是我们还没有准备好，我们没有一个“好的开始”。

## 3. Success at Scale in the Age of AI
But here is the game changer: **AI.**
In the past, finding the right direction meant long-term, expensive trial and error.
Now? You just need to try a little, do a little, and ask AI.
AI drastically lowers the barrier to entry. It reduces the cost of making mistakes. It makes a "good start" accessible to almost everyone.
Because the difficulty of starting has plummeted, I believe that **in the age of AI, success will happen at scale.**

So, take a deep breath. The tools are in our hands. Embrace the challenge.

## 3. AI 时代的规模化成功
但现在的规则改变了：因为有了 **AI**。
在过去，找到正确的方向意味着长期、昂贵的试错。
现在呢？你只需要稍微试一下，做一点点，然后问问 AI。
AI 大幅降低了入门的门槛。它降低了试错的成本。它让“好的开始”变得触手可及。
正因为开头的难度大幅下降，我相信，**在 AI 时代，成功将会是大规模发生的。**

所以，深吸一口气。工具就在我们手中。迎接挑战吧。
