# The Fear of Losing the "Zone"

## 1. It's Not About the Money
I was chatting with my wife today about renting houses near the university. I saw a great place, perfect for us, but I held back. Not because I couldn't afford it, but because right now, my priority isn't comfort—it's maintaining my state of mind.

What I fear most isn't running out of money; it's losing this "learning state."
I know this feeling well. It's a rare, hyper-focused zone.
I had it before my Bar Exam—I crushed it in two weeks.
I had it before the Gaokao—I mastered it in two months.
But every time, the moment the exam was over, I collapsed. The focus evaporated. I became lazy again.

# 恐惧“状态”的消逝

## 1. 无关金钱
今天和老婆聊起在学校附近租房的事。我看到了一套很棒的房子，非常适合我们一家三口，但我忍住了。不是因为租不起，而是因为现阶段，我的首要任务不是舒适，而是维持我的心境。

我最担心的不是缺钱，而是失去现在的这种“学习状态”。
这种感觉我太熟悉了。这是一种罕见的、极度专注的领域（Zone）。
我在法考前有过这种状态——两周搞定。
我在高考前也有过——两个月搞定。
但每一次，考试一结束，我就像泄了气的皮球。那种专注力瞬间蒸发，我又变回了那个懈怠的自己。

## 2. The "What If" Question
During those past sprints, I often asked myself a haunting question:
*"If I could just maintain this level of efficiency forever, how incredible would I become?"*

But back then, the answer was always: *"Impossible."*
It felt like a temporary superpower that I could only borrow, never own.
That's why I cherish this opportunity in Ireland so much. This time, it feels different. It feels like I've finally grasped what I've always wanted. I am not just sprinting for an exam; I am rebuilding my entire operating system.

I am scared that if I stop, even for a moment, this magic will vanish. So I keep pushing, not because I am strong, but because I am terrified of going back to being ordinary.

## 2. 那个“如果”的问题
在过去的那些冲刺阶段，我常暗自慨叹，问自己一个折磨人的问题：
*“我要是能一直保持这个效率，我该牛逼到什么程度呢？”*

但那时候，答案总是：*“根本不可能！”*
那感觉就像是一种临时的超能力，我只能借用，却无法拥有。
所以我才如此珍惜这次在爱尔兰的机会。这一次，感觉不一样了。我感觉我终于抓住了我一直想要的东西。我不再是为了某场考试而冲刺，我是在重构我的整个操作系统。

我很害怕，害怕一旦停下来，这种魔力就会消失。所以我不断逼自己，不是因为我有多强，而是因为我太害怕变回那个平庸的自己。

## 3. The Anchor
I told my wife today: *"We've held on for almost three months. Another two months is nothing. I believe that in four months, everything will be different."*

Truth be told, I couldn't do this alone.
Without her, I would have given up.
Without her, I would have continued to "lose" at the game of life.
She is the reason I can endure the commuting, the coding until midnight, and the loneliness. I will endure the cheap student accommodation, the long walks, and the fatigue. I will save the best house for when she arrives.

We will make it. We definitely will.

## 3. 锚点
今天我对老婆说：*“我们已经坚持快三个月了，再有两个这么久，说什么我也得坚持下来。我相信再有四个月，一切都会很不一样。”*

说实话，光靠我自己做不到。
没有她，我可能早就放弃了。
没有她，我这辈子可能会继续“亏”下去。
她是我能忍受通勤、忍受午夜编程、忍受孤独的原因。我会忍受现在的廉价宿舍，忍受长途步行，忍受疲惫。我要把最好的房子留到她来的那一刻。

我们会做到的。我们一定行。
