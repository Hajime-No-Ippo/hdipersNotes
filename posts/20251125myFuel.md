summary_zh: "我曾试图与心中那个“心如止水”的自己和解，但我失败了。我意识到，“稳如老狗”绝对不是我的风格。我坦然接受我的高振幅本性——狂喜的高峰和破碎的低谷。那才是我的燃料。"

# Making Peace with Chaos

## 1. The Obsession with "Steady"
I used to be obsessed with the idea of being "Steady as an Old Dog" (稳如老狗)—unshakable, calm, emotionless in the face of victory or defeat.
I thought that was maturity. I thought that was the ultimate form of strength.
For years, I tried to suppress my extreme highs and hide my extreme lows, trying to mold myself into that stable image.
But today, I admit it: **I failed.**

# 与混乱共存

## 1. 对“稳”的执念
我曾经非常执着于通过修炼达到“稳如老狗”的境界——那种胜不骄败不馁、泰山崩于前而色不变的淡定。
我以为那是成熟。我以为那是力量的终极形态。
很多年里，我试图压抑我极度的狂喜，掩盖我极度的低落，强行把自己塞进那个“稳定”的模具里。
但今天，我承认：**我失败了。**

## 2. Rejection, Not Reconciliation
People say you should "make peace" with your flaws.
But I am not making peace with the fact that I can't be calm. **I am celebrating it.**
"Steady as a rock"? That’s just not me.
If I solve a hard algorithm, I want to scream. I want to feel like I own the world.
If I fail, I want to feel the crushing weight of it.
That volatility isn't a bug; it's a feature. It's the turbocharger that powers my 16-hour coding sessions. It's the fire that got me to Ireland when all doors were closed.

## 2. 不是和解，是拒绝
人们常说要与自己的缺点“和解”。
但我不想和“我做不到心如止水”这件事和解。**我要庆祝它。**
“稳如老狗”？那绝对不是我的 Style。
如果我解出了一道难题，我就要狂喜，我就要觉得自己拥有了全世界。
如果我失败了，我就要感受那种被碾压的痛。
这种波动不是 Bug，它是 Feature（特性）。正是这种不稳定性，构成了驱动我连续编程16小时的涡轮增压；正是这股火，让我在所有门都关上时，依然杀到了爱尔兰。

## 3. My Own Frequency
A flat line on an ECG machine means death. Life is a wave.
My wave just happens to have a higher amplitude than others.
So, I am done pretending to be a refrigerator that hums quietly in the corner.
I am an engine that roars and overheats.
I don't need to be steady. I just need to be **moving**.
And right now, powered by this chaos, I am moving faster than ever.

# 3. 我自己的频率
心电图上的一条直线意味着死亡。生命本身就是波动的。
只不过，我的波幅比别人大一点而已。
所以，我不装了。我做不了那个在角落里安静嗡嗡作响的冰箱。
我就是那台会轰鸣、会过热的引擎。
我不需要“稳”。我只需要**向前**。
而现在，在混乱的驱动下，我比以往任何时候都要快。
