# The Power of Being a "Fool"

## 1. The Clash of Politeness
I come from a culture where politeness often means saving face. We hesitate to point out mistakes publicly to avoid embarrassment. But here in the West, specifically in engineering culture, directness is valued.
I realized my "Chinese politeness" could be a barrier. So, I made a disclaimer to my classmates:
*"If I seem rude, it's a cultural difference, not my intention. And please, if I am rude, point it out directly. I want to learn."*
This simple act of "showing my cards" dissolved the tension. It turned potential offense into curiosity and mutual respect.

# 做一个“笨蛋”的力量

## 1. 礼貌的冲突
我来自一个讲究“面子”的文化。我们往往避免在公开场合指出别人的错误，以免让人难堪。但在西方的工程文化里，直率是被推崇的。
我意识到我的“中式礼貌”可能会成为一种阻碍。于是，我对我的同学们做了一个“免责声明”：
*“如果我看起来很粗鲁，那是文化差异，不是我的本意。另外，拜托大家，如果我有不礼貌的地方，请直接指出来。我想学习。”*
这个简单的“打明牌”的动作，瞬间消解了潜在的紧张感。它把可能的冒犯转化为了好奇心和相互尊重。

## 2. Why Are You So Honest?
A classmate asked me today, surprised: *"Why are you so open about your struggles? You tell everyone you don't understand things, that you're working hard but still failing."*
Most people try to hide their weaknesses. They want to appear smart and in control.
I told her: *"Because before I came here, I accepted that I would be 'not smart' for a while. I gave myself two months to transition from a 'fool' to 'less of a fool'."*
This anonymity is my freedom. No one knows who I was. If I fail, I just go home.
Because I have nothing to lose, I have nothing to hide.

## 2. 你为什么这么坦诚？
今天有个同学很惊讶地问我：*“你为什么对自己的挣扎这么坦诚？你逢人就说你听不懂，说你很努力但还是学不好。”*
大多数人都试图掩盖自己的弱点，想让自己看起来聪明、游刃有余。
我告诉她：*“因为来这里之前，我就已经接受了自己会当一段时间‘笨蛋’的事实。我给了自己两个月的时间，从一个‘笨蛋’变成‘没那么笨’。”*
这种匿名感是我的自由。没人知道我过去是谁。如果失败了，大不了回国。
因为我没有什么可失去的，所以我没有什么可隐藏的。

## 3. Radical Honesty as Leadership
She said something profound: *"You must be honest with yourself."*
I agreed: *"Yes. You have to be honest enough to convince yourself to do what you believe is right. And if you can convince others to be honest with themselves too... maybe that's what makes you a leader."*

Leadership isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about having the courage to face reality, admit what you don't know, and still say, "Let's figure this out together."
My vulnerability didn't make me weak; it made me real. And in a new world, being real is the strongest asset I have.

## 3. 极致坦诚即领导力
她说了一句很深刻的话：*“一定要对自己诚实。”*
我说：*“是的。你必须足够诚实，才能说服自己去干你认为正确的事。如果你能说服别人也对自己诚实……也许，这就是领袖的样子。”*

领导力不是做屋子里最聪明的人。而是有勇气面对现实，承认自己不知道，然后依然坚定地说：“咱们一起把它搞定。”
我的脆弱没有让我变弱，它让我变得真实。而在一个陌生的新世界里，真实，就是我最强的资产。
