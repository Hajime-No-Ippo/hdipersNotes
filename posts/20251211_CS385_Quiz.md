### Q1: React State Updates

```javascript
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Alice', age: 25 });
// Later in a handler:
setUser({ age: 26 });
What is the value of user after the next render?

A) { name: 'Alice', age: 26 } B) { age: 26 } C) { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
```

<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

{ age: 26 }

Rationale: The useState hook replaces the state value entirely; unlike class components' this.setState, it does not automatically merge objects. You would need setUser({ ...user, age: 26 }).

</details>
```javascript
Q2: JavaScript Array Map
JavaScript

const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const result = nums.map(n => {
  n * 2;
});
```
What is the value of result?

A) [2, 4, 6] B) [1, 2, 3] C) [undefined, undefined, undefined]

<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: C

[undefined, undefined, undefined]

Rationale: The arrow function uses a block { ... } but lacks a return statement. Without an explicit return, JS functions return undefined. To fix it, remove the braces n => n * 2 or add return.

</details>
```javascript
Q3: React Effects & Dependencies
JavaScript

useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Effect ran');
}, [props.user]);
If props.user is an object, when might this run too frequently?
```
A) If props.user is null. B) If the parent component creates a new user object on every render. C) If the effect does not return a cleanup function.

<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

Rationale: In JavaScript, objects are compared by reference. { id: 1 } !== { id: 1 }. If the parent passes a new object reference every time (even with same data), React sees it as changed and re-runs the effect.

</details>
```javascript
Q4: Bootstrap Display Utilities
Which class hides an element on mobile (xs) but shows it on medium (md) and larger?

A) d-hidden d-md-show B) d-none d-md-block C) d-block d-sm-none
```
<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

Rationale: Bootstrap is mobile-first. d-none applies to xs and up. d-md-block overrides it starting at the md breakpoint.

</details>

Q5: Async Execution Order
```javascript

console.log(1);
setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3));
console.log(4);
Output Order?

A) 1, 2, 3, 4 B) 1, 4, 3, 2 C) 1, 4, 2, 3
```
<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

1, 4, 3, 2

Rationale:

Sync code runs first: 1, 4.

Microtasks (Promises) run next: 3.

Macrotasks (setTimeout) run last: 2.

</details>

Q6: React Boolean Rendering
```javascript

const count = 0;
return <div>{count && <h1>Hi</h1>}</div>;
What is rendered?

A) Nothing B) 0 C) false
```
<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

0

Rationale: In JS, 0 && anything evaluates to 0. React renders the number 0 in the DOM. To fix this, use count > 0 && ... or !!count && ....

</details>

Q7: JS Objects as Keys
```javascript

const a = {};
const b = { key: 'b' };
const c = { key: 'c' };

a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;

console.log(a[b]);
Output?
```
A) 123 B) 456 C) undefined

<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

456

Rationale: Object keys are converted to strings. Both b and c convert to "[object Object]". So a[c] overwrites the value at that same key string.

</details>

Q8: React Keys
```javascript
Why is Math.random() bad for list keys?

A) Duplicate key errors. B) It forces React to unmount/recreate elements on every render. C) It is insecure.
```
<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

Rationale: Keys tell React which elements are stable. If the key changes every render, React thinks it's a completely new element, destroys the old DOM, and builds a new one. This kills performance and loses state (like input focus).

</details>

Q9: JS Sorting
```javascript

const arr = [1, 2, 15, 3];
arr.sort();
Result?
```
A) [1, 2, 3, 15] B) [1, 15, 2, 3] C) [15, 3, 2, 1]

<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

[1, 15, 2, 3]

Rationale: Default .sort() converts elements to strings and sorts alphabetically. "15" comes before "2". Use arr.sort((a,b) => a-b) for numbers.

</details>

Q10: React Router
```javascript
<a> vs <Link>?
```
A) No difference. B) <a> is full reload, <Link> is SPA navigation. C) <a> is faster.

<details> <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #facc15; font-weight: bold;">▼ Click to Reveal Answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B

Rationale: <Link> uses the History API to change the URL without refreshing the page, preserving your React state. <a> triggers a browser refresh.

</details>

Good luck tomorrow! We got this. 👊 [END]
