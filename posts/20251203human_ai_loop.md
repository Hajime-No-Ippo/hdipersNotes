# Teaching the AI to Teach Me

## 1. The Art of "Demanding More"
Today, I finally cracked the Backtracking algorithm. But the real victory wasn't the code; it was the conversation that led to it.
I realized that AI can help me understand, but passive consumption isn't enough.
Standard explanations are often generic. To get that "Inception-style" metaphor that finally clicked for me, I had to push the AI. I had to say, "No, that's not clear enough. Explain the relationship between the `for` loop and the recursion again."

**This is the new "Teaching benefits teachers and students alike" (教学相长).**
To ask a high-quality question, I must first have a high-quality doubt. I need to know *exactly* where I am stuck.
By demanding more from the AI, I am actually demanding more from myself. I am training myself to dissect logic until I find the flaw. I am not just a user; I am an active director of my own learning.

# 教 AI 教会我

## 1. “得寸进尺”的艺术
今天，我终于彻底搞懂了回溯算法。但真正的胜利不在于代码，而在于通往代码的那场对话。
我意识到，AI 确实能帮我理解，但被动地接收是远远不够的。
标准的解释往往是通用的、平庸的。为了得到那个让我瞬间顿悟的“盗梦空间”比喻，我必须逼迫 AI。我必须说：“不，这还不够清楚。再给我解释一遍 `for` 循环和递归的关系。”

**这就是新时代的“教学相长”。**
为了提出一个高质量的问题，我自己必须先产生高质量的怀疑。我必须精准地知道我*到底*卡在哪里。
通过对 AI 提出更高的要求，我实际上是在对自己提出更高的要求。我在训练自己去解剖逻辑，直到找到那个断点。我不再只是一个用户；我是我自己学习过程的导演。

# 2. The "Kink" in the Hose
Every complex concept—whether it's KMP, Binary Trees, or Backtracking—isn't equally hard everywhere.
It usually has just 1 or 2 "Kinks" (拐点).
* For Backtracking, the kink was realizing that "Reality is BFS, Dream is DFS."
* For KMP, it was the rollback logic of `j`.

Most people stop when they hit the kink. They memorize the code and move on.
But my strategy is to attack the kink.
We need to straighten out these specific twisting points. Once that knot is untied, the water flows. The knowledge isn't just memorized; it's structural. It becomes part of you, and you will never forget it.

# 2. 水管上的那个“结”
任何复杂的知识点——无论是 KMP、二叉树还是回溯——并不是处处都难。
它们通常只有 1 到 2 个**“拐点”**（Kinks）。
* 对于回溯，这个拐点就是领悟“现实是广搜，梦境是深搜”。
* 对于 KMP，是 `j` 的回退逻辑。

大多数人撞到拐点就停了。他们背下代码，然后继续赶路。
但我的策略是：**死磕那个拐点**。
我们需要做的，就是把那这一两个打结的地方给捋直了。一旦那个结解开了，水自然就流通了。这种知识不再是死记硬背的，它是结构化的。它成为了你的一部分，你永远都不会忘。
