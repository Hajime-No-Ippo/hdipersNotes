# The Friday Pact

## 1. The Breathless 45 Minutes
I talked to Mark (the PhD student) today. It lasted 45 minutes.
I was outputting non-stop. I could physically feel my shortness of breath. I was nervous, speaking fast, trying to optimize every second to show my value and test my communication limits.
I regret not recording it, but the intensity burned it into my memory.
We spoke at a rapid-fire pace. He was fast. I was fast (out of nerves). It was like a ping-pong match played at 2x speed.

# 周五之约

## 1. 窒息的45分钟
今天我和 Mark（那位博士生）聊了45分钟。
我一直在疯狂输出。我能感觉到自己呼吸局促。我很紧张，语速飞快，试图榨干每一秒钟来展示价值，同时测试我的沟通极限。
我后悔没有录音，但那种高强度让这一切刻进了我的脑海。
我们的语速都很快。他快，我也快（因为紧张）。这就像是一场 2 倍速播放的乒乓球赛。

## 2. The Mirror Effect: Italy vs. Dublin
I shared my struggles—living in a crowded rental, staying at school to avoid going "home."
To my surprise, he smiled.
He told me he spent six months in Italy last year. He had terrible accommodation too. He forced himself out to study and explore just to avoid staying in his room.
He used AI to learn languages; I use AI to learn Java.
When I mentioned **"Zero Embarrassment,"** his eyes lit up. He agreed completely.
We are different people, but we are fighting the same war.

## 2. 镜像效应：意大利与都柏林
我分享了我的挣扎——住在拥挤的群租房，为了不回“家”而赖在学校。
令我惊讶的是，他笑了。
他告诉我，他去年在意大利待了半年。他的住处也很差。他也是逼着自己出去学习、游览，只为了减少在住处待着的时间。
他用 AI 学语言；我用 AI 学 Java。
当我提到 **“零尴尬感” (Zero Embarrassment)** 时，他的眼睛亮了。他完全同意。
我们是不同的人，但我们在打同一场战争。

## 3. The Deal: Wasting Time with Great Minds
The outcome? We made a deal.
**Every Friday, 3 PM. We talk.**
This is a massive win.
I don't want to "get" anything specific from him—no job referrals, no shortcuts.
I just want to **"waste time"** with high-level, thoughtful people.
I want to clash my ideas against a PhD's brain. I want to expose my nervousness and use it as data.
I have nothing to be afraid of. The worst case is I learn something. The best case is we build something amazing.
See you next Friday, Mark.

## 3. 成交：与高尚的灵魂“浪费时间”
结果？我们达成了一个协议。
**每周五，下午 3 点。固定通话。**
这是一个巨大的胜利。
我并不想从他那里“索取”什么具体的利益——不需要内推，不需要捷径。
我只想和高水平、有思想的人一起 **“浪费时间”**。
我想拿我的想法去碰撞博士的大脑。我想暴露我的紧张，并把它作为改进的数据。
我没什么好怕的。最坏的结果是我学到了东西。最好的结果是我们一起创造出惊人的东西。
下周五见，Mark。
